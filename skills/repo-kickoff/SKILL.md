# Repo Kickoff

## Goal
Establish a fast, correct baseline before writing code.

## Workflow
1. Inspect repository layout and key config files first.
2. Confirm toolchain and test commands.
3. Summarize current state, risks, and likely impact areas.
4. Propose the smallest viable first change.

## Constraints
- Prefer non-destructive commands.
- Avoid assumptions that can be verified from files.
- Keep scope tight and outcomes testable.
